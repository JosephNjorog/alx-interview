## Project Overview

As a full-stack developer, I have created this repository to help fellow developers and students prepare for technical interviews. The repository includes a range of tasks and projects, each designed to tackle specific problems often encountered in interviews. The solutions are implemented using various programming languages and technologies to provide a well-rounded preparation experience.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories based on different interview topics and problems. Here is a brief overview of the structure:

```

│   └── solution.py
├── 0x01-es6_data_manipulation/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── array_manipulation.js
│   └── set_map_manipulation.js
└── README.md
```

### Directories

- **0x00-lockboxes/**: Contains the solution for the "Lockboxes" problem.
